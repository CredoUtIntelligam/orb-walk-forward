# ORB Walk-Forward

Private research repository for Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy research and walk-forward analysis, primarily on MES/ES futures.

This repo is designed to be driven by looping Grok Bots (orchestrator + specialized engineer) with Cursor handoffs.

## Goal
Build a robust, reproducible walk-forward framework for ORB variants (range length, entry confirmation, filters, targets/stops, etc.) using Databento data where available. Results should support the existing Vega bot's ORB research.

## Structure
- `src/` — Core Python modules for data loading, ORB signal generation, walk-forward engine, metrics.
- `notebooks/` — Exploratory analysis and result visualization.
- `results/` — Walk-forward outputs (CSV, plots, summaries). Gitignored large files.
- `templates/` — Bot descriptions, prompt examples, and orchestration notes.
- `docs/` — Additional methodology notes.

## Looping Grok Bots Workflow
- **Orchestrator**: Bob (Chief of Staff)
- **Specialist**: Engineer bot focused on quant research / ORB walk-forward (to be created)

Typical loop:
1. Orchestrator instructs Engineer to work on a concrete next step in this repo (every N minutes).
2. Engineer implements, commits, or opens a PR (often via Cursor cloud agent handoff).
3. Orchestrator reviews progress periodically and suggests one improvement to keep the work on track and self-improving.

See `templates/` for bot description drafts and example prompts.

## Notes
- Keep data out of git (use Databento, local caches, or secure storage).
- Prefer clear, testable code over one-off notebooks for the core engine.
- Boundaries: no live trading, no credential exposure, explicit approval for any external actions beyond this repo.
